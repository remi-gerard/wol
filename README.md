This program allows users to wake up from home their computers in the office (using the Wake-on-LAN standard). The UI tells the users to wait 5 minutes and displays the procedure to make an RDP session.

The content is written in french.

You can customise the UI with your own logo. Rename your logo "blason.jpg" and paste it on the lib directory.

I wrote this program during the COVID-19 epidemic.
