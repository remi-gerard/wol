# wol

This program allows users to wake up from home their computers in the office (using the Wake-on-LAN standard). The UI tells the users to wait 5 minutes and displays the procedure to make an RDP session.

Usage : 
```

```

The content is written in french.

You can customise the UI with your own logo. Rename your logo "blason.jpg" and paste it on the lib directory.

I wrote this program during the COVID-19 epidemic.
